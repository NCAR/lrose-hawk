# lrose-hawk

## Purpose

lrose-hawk stores the parameter files, scripts and the real-time control configuration
for projects that make use of the LROSE software for radar processing, starting with 
**time-series processing** and clutter filtering.

Also included are algorithms, Cartesian transformation, merging with other data sets,
displays and data archival.

The intention is that these configurations can be used as templates, from which
the real-time setup for other projects may be derived.
