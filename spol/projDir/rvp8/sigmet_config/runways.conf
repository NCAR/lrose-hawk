# Contains configuration information for the TDWR/LLWAS integration
# algorithm and the runways utility.  IRIS will generate a syntax error

# and invalid args, including number out of the valid range.

# Number of runways to define:
COUNT 3

# For each runways: Primary direction, Secondary direction, default direction.
# The default direction is the direction to use at powerup until changed
# manually by runways.

# West longitude.

# There are 6 threshold in m/s specified for each runway for each system.
# These are:
# THRESH1: Seam between weak and strong WSA gains
# THRESH2: Weak WSA gains require this level of confirmation to pass.
# THRESH3: Seam between weak and strong WSA losses
# THRESH4: Weak WSA losses require this level of confirmation to pass.
# THRESH5: Seam between weak and strong MBA losses
# THRESH6: Weak MBA losses require this level of confirmation to pass, 
#          otherwise they are lowered to MAX_WSA.
# In normal use THRESH3 >= MIN_MBA >= THRESH5.
