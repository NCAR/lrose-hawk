== HAWK checkout ==

=== Introduction ===

At present, HAWK is checked into the RAL CVS server. This applies to both the code and the system configuration and scripts.

At some point, some or all of this project should be check into a repository at EOL.

=== Setting CVSROOT ===

Set up your CVSROOT to check out from RAL's CVS server.

For example:

{{{ 
  setenv CVSROOT :pserver:dixon@cvs.rap.ucar.edu:/cvs
}}}

If you have forwarded CVS to the SPOL machines, and you are checking out on one of these, you can use something like:

{{{
  setenv CVSROOT :pserver:dixon@localhost:/cvs
}}}

In order to forward CVS from one host to another using ssh tunneling, use an alias something like:

{{{
 alias cvsforward 'ssh -a -x -C -R 2401:localhost:2401'
}}}

The cvsforward alias is included in the .cshrc file for HAWK.
 
=== Check out the SPOL distribs directory ===

{{{
 mkdir cvs
 cd cvs
 cvs co distribs/spol
}}}

In the directory:

{{{
  cvs/distribs/spol/hawk
}}}

you will find the following checkout scripts:

{{{
  spol_display_checkout
  spol_gate_checkout
  spol_mgen_checkout
  spol_pgen_checkout
  spol_rvp8_checkout
}}}

=== Check out HAWK for your host type ===

Check out HAWK using the checkout script for your selected host type.

For example:

{{{
  cd cvs
  ./distribs/spol/hawk/spol_mgen_checkout
}}}

will check out the system for the host type 'mgen'.
