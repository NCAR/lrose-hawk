I've gone ahead and setup a few simple scripts for the Radiometer to automatically send files to the Local Field Catlog.  On her Radiometer computer, here are the locations of the files and scripts.

Current Data that has not been sent - C:\operating\Data\
Data that has been sent to the field Catalog - C:\operating\Data_Processed\
FTP Script directory - C:\operating\ftpscripts\

Within that ftpscripts directory I have two scripts.  

ftp.scr - This script contains the instructions that the FTP client understands.  It uploads all .png and .csv files in the c:\operating\data directory to 192.168.4.38 (nomad) to the /pub/incoming/radiometer directory.

ftp.bat - This calls the ftp.scr and then moves all the .csv and .png files in C:\operating\data\ to c:\operating\data_proccessed\

Windows Task Schedule then calls the ftp.bat script and runs it every hour currently.  You can find more about windows task scheduler and how it works here - http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308671.  Or just google it.  There is quite a bit of information out there on it.
