Instructions for swapping Juniper Firewalls

We have two Juniper Firewall Appliances - our original SRX 210 and our new SRX240.  Only
1 of these firewall can be plugged into the Internet and the S-Pol network at any given time.
(Both firewall have the same I.P. addresses and will probably bring down connection to the 
Internet if you happened to plug them in at the same time.)

If the SRX 210 were to fail, you'll need to move all the cables to the alternate firewall.

The left most ethernet port (NOT the serial console port!) is the connection to the Internet.
Ports to the right of the internet port are for internal S-Pol network connections.

You can access the SRX240 via the second ethernet port on control3 as 192.168.1.251, using 
ge-0/0/15, the right most ethernet port.  This lets us configure the spare firewall without having 
to attach a laptop.
