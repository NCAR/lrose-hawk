SPOL-Ka UPGRADE LIST
====================

Lessons learned from DYNAMO.
Preparing for FRONT and later projects.

1. Angle measurement system
---------------------------

Upgrade to faster processor for S2D.

Upgrade to LINUX kernel with faster interrupt rate.

Perhaps change from chrony to ntpd for time sync.

Change to use FPGA instead of the LINUX CPU to manipulate
angles and encode the angles on the output parallel lines.

Use LINUX host for UDP and LCD output only.

2. S-band arcing / arc detection
--------------------------------

Find cause of arcing.

Determine whether arcing can be prevented with dry air only.

Install arc detector system for remote ops monitoring.

Would it make sense to add a purge valve on the waveguide
high on the antenna, to assist with purging the waveguide?

3. Mitch switch
---------------

Investigate further why bearings only last a month or two.

Try to improve bearing reliability.

4. Rotary joint with fiber optic cable
--------------------------------------

We need a spare rotary joint with fiber fitted.

Determine the cost of purchasing a spare.

Can we upgrade our existing spare to have a fiber installed?

5. Slip rings
-------------

Are the slip rings OK?

What causes the Ka-band transmitter breaker to trip?

Can we change the system so that the ATE does not use as many
slip rings? (See 6 below).

6. Monitoring / ATE on antenna
------------------------------

Investigate installing computer on antenna for monitoring,
controlling the ATE, etc.

Would doing this free up some slip rings?

Can we use redundant slip rings for k-band power to make it more reliable?

7. Remote operations
--------------------

Enable remote control and monitoring of:

  generator
  power system
  transmitter
  mitch switch

Add more monitoring of temperatures in transmitter container, and
in the transmitter itself.

Add camera inside transmitter container.

8. Air conditioning for S-band transmitter
------------------------------------------

Review AC needs for S-band transmitter container.

Install sufficient cooling units so that a single unit can
fail without compromising the transmitter - i.e. we can run
with one AC unit down.

9. Computers / RAIDS
--------------------

Review existing computer hardware.

triton RAID on pgen1 is bad.

Replace aging hardware.

Install RAIDS of sufficient size that the data from an entire
project can be stored.

10. S-band signal processing
----------------------------

Add new signal processor, probably using CHILL system.
Run RVP8 and new processor in parallel for development and testing.

Add phase-coding capability for range unfolding for 3 trips.

Add oversampling in range capability.

Upgrade clutter filtering to use 'waterfall' methods similar
to profilers.

11. Ka-band
-----------

Consider circular polarization for Ka-band.

Consider new antenna.

Investigate reasons for arcing at full power.

Consider upgrading single-board computers to latest model.

Check temperature of CPU and hard drive in drx.

12. K-band cooling and air conditioning
---------------------------------------

Review cooling needs for all 3 Ka-band units.

Add active cooling as required.

13. Product generation
----------------------

Add algorithms for generating products for science team.
For example:

  upgraded PID algorithm
  precip estimation
  refractivity
  storm tracking
  upgraded gridding
  liquid water from S/Ka-band
  non-rain cloud fraction using Ka-band
  updated REPoH as required

14. Infrastructure
------------------

Do we need a permanent container 9?

Can we replace the bad chairs?

Consider spare AC units for personnel containers.

15. Tech windows computer
-------------------------

All windows hosts must be set up for field ops, and be independent
from the typical hosts at EOL.

We need all of the administrator passwords.

The PPMAC IDE must be installed with all necessary plug-ins and packages.

We need a laptop or spare computer, which can be used if tech goes down.

16. Antenna control / K-band transmitter control
------------------------------------------------

Add feature to let a user 'take control', so we don't have
more than one user controlling the antenna or transmitter at
a time.

17. kadrx
---------

The kadrx app has a number of problems:

(a) velocity loses coherence

(b) kadrx aborts with message:

   p7142sd3cdnThread for channel 1 got data for channel 0!

(c) We get lots of missing pulses.

(d) burst power and phase should be computed using a coherent mean.

18. S-band simultaneous HV mode
-------------------------------

Automate SHV mode.

Test ops.

Test moments generation.
