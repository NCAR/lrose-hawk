Title:	How to set up passphrase-less ssh(1)/scp(1) access between hosts.
=========================================================================

Overview

    ssh and scp can use RSA public key authentication to control access
    between hosts.  To do this, you first generate a private/public
    key pair on each host.  Normally this key is generated using a
    passphrase for authentication purposes.  If the keys are generated
    with no passphrase, then none will be required.  The public keys
    are then collected and distributed to each host, which allows
    free access.


To set up ssh authentication you need to create two files: known_hosts
and authorized_hosts and copy these files to /home/aoaws/.ssh on
each machine

To create authorized_hosts:
===========================

1) Login to any host and open up a file called 

  /home/aoaws/.ssh/authorized_keys.aoaws
  We will generate host id's on each host and copy
  them to this file.

2) In another xterm, login to each host and do the following:

   * run the command "ssh-keygen -b 1024 -N '' -t dsa"
     This will create a file called /home/aoaws/.ssh/id_dsa.pub 
   * cat /home/aoaws/.ssh/id_dsa.pub
   * copy and paste the output to your file authorized_keys.aoaws
   
   Eg. If running ssh-keygen on machine wmds the output to cat will 
       look like this:

   Make another copy of this line with the modification of having the 
   fully qualified domain name and also paste it in authorized_keys.aoaws.

To create known_hosts:
======================

1) On any machine as aoaws, open up a file called known_hosts.aoaws

2) Open up another xterm on this machine, and login as user aoaws to every other 
   machine (including the one you are on) and then logout. If prompted while logging in, 
   answer yes.  This will create  a /home/aoaws/.ssh/known_hosts file with each line
   containing the machine name, IP address and id of the aoaws machines.

3) Cat /home/aoaws/.ssh/known_hosts.
   Copy each line into known_hosts.aoaws and  make another copy of each 
   line with the modification of having a fully qualified domain name and
   also past it into known_hosts.aoaws

for example, for machine wmds in known_hosts.aoaws we have:

mail,128.117.200.41 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAwEdOOC6tjzVvv
R58z51H3kJJUvr3JKW6qAzrDxsVKyQD1fAURnR5qPBQNXPCPasq59Q6rW2Z3j4mwV/hay
OKbtn4/vzY37GWPMaF7vNsBBg4PzOHO+bUqmu9QrFBO4AFu0CeXtuWMRS5HvBU1Iyots
UEqv2+Rw5PesSNDJppeRE=

mail.aoaws.caa.gov.tw,128.117.200.41 ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAIEAwEdOOC6tjzVvv
R58z51H3kJJUvr3JKW6qAzrDxsVKyQD1fAURnR5qPBQNXPCPasq59Q6rW2Z3j4mwV/hay
OKbtn4/vzY37GWPMaF7vNsBBg4PzOHO+bUqmu9QrFBO4AFu0CeXtuWMRS5HvBU1Iyots
UEqv2+Rw5PesSNDJppeRE=


Copy the files around:
======================

Now copy the files:

  cp /home/aoaws/.ssh/authorized_keys.aoaws /home/aoaws/.ssh/authorized_keys
  cp /home/aoaws/.ssh/known_hosts.aoaws /home/aoaws/.ssh/known_hosts

Then ssh the files to all the hosts in the project:
 
  foreach host (host1 host2 ..... hostn)
  scp /home/aoaws/.ssh/authorized_keys $host\:.ssh
  scp /home/aoaws/.ssh/known_hosts $host\:.ssh

Check the permissions:
======================

In addition, check that the following is true:

  $HOME is not writeable by the group or world
  $HOME/.ssh is only visible to the owner, i.e., 'chmod 700 $HOME/.ssh'
  $HOME/.ssh/* is only visible to the owner, i.e., 'chmod 600 $HOME/.ssh/*'
