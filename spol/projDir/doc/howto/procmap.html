<h2>Keeping the processes running</h2>

<p>
The processes are kept running using the auto-restart system.

<p>
This has two components:

<ul>
<li>procmap - the process mapper</li><p>
<li>auto_restart - the auto-restart script</li><p>
</ul>

<h3>procmap</h3>

<p>The process mapper is called <b>procmap</b>. procmap keeps a record
of which processes are currently running.

<p>At regular intervals, normally once per minute, each process
registers a 'heartbeat' with procmap. That way procmap can keep track
of which processes are working and heartbeating correctly.

See <a href="checking_the_processes.html">checking the processes</a>
for information on how to print out the process list on a host.

<h3>auto_restart</h3>

<p>Also at regular intervals the 'auto_restart' script contacts the procmap
to get the list of current processes. It compares this list with the required
process list, which is found the the following file:

<p><pre>    ~/projDir/control/proc_list</pre>

<p>If a process is missing or has not sent a heartbeat recently, the auto_restart
script will restart the missing process. Before performing the restart it will
first try to kill the process, just in case it is still running but is in a
hung state.

<p>The auto_restart script logs all restarts to the following file:

<p><pre>    ~/projDir/logs/restart/today/auto_restart.log</pre>
