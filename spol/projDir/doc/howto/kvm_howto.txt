How to access S-Pol via the KVM

For the FRONT location, the KVM is accessible as spol-kvm.front.ucar.edu.  In the field, we will create a DYNDNS hostname,
spol-kvm.dyndns.org.

First, you may have to configure your browser to connect to the Avocent KVM.  (We can't replace the security certificate, 
and your browser may object to connecting to an "insecure" web site.)

For Chrome, if you get the message "Your connection is not private", 
click 'Advanced',

click "proceed to spol-kvm.front.ucar.edu(unsafe)"

Login to the KVM (see Joe or Mike for the username/password)

1) To login to a computer:
         a) click on a computer name (with the computer icon).
         b) On the next screen, click on "KVM Session".
         c) Find the downloaded file 'session_launchxx.jnlp'
         d) doubleclick the jnlp file
         e) On a Mac, you may have to open the System Preference "Security & Privacy" control panel to give the KVM session app
            permission to run.  (The app isn't signed).
         f) give Java permission to run the KVM console session.

2) To control power on a specific outlet:
