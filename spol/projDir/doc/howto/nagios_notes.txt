Notes on Nagios monitoring:
Read the pages under https://wiki.ucar.edu/display/spoltech/Nagios+Pages for background.


The web login for check_mk/nagios is:
login: omdadmin
passwd: omd4spol!!


To change any Nagios configuration, you must be logged in as 'prod'.
(you can always login as root, then type 'su - prod')

(Note if you change files as root, you may mess up the permissions.)

Nagios Configuration is located under  
control1:~prod

Key configuration files:
~prod/etc/check_mk/main.mk

~prod/etc/nagios/conf.d/contacts.cfg  
	- defines phone numbers, time periods,  contact groups



After changing the configuration files or modifying host configuration or scripts:

control1 # su - prod 

OMD[prod]:~$ cmk -II # run inventory
OMD[prod]:~$ cmk -R # regenerate Nagios configuration

OMD[prod]:~$ check_mk -O   

Adding more checks:
For each computer we monitor, check_mk automatically invokes all scripts located under
/usr/share/check_mk_agent/local

These scripts generate lines of the form:
------------
2 HawkSummary_Data - 7 ok, 9 problems
0 HD_mdv/radial/moments/sband - OK
------------
Each line contains a status (0=ok, 1=warn, 2=Error), the name of the checked item, and a text summary.
The "check_mk -II" command looks at the output from each script and generates the 
necessary nagios configuration files.

mgen:projDir/mgen/params/SpolTsMonitor.kband
contains the settings for the Ka band nagios monitoring.


Troubleshooting:
If Dell OpenManage isn't reporting results ("Unknown ..."), 
/opt/dell/srvadmin/sbin/srvadmin-services.sh restart





Fine tuning  Nagios:
To ignore particular services, add them to the 'ignored_services' line in
etc/check_mk/main.mk

Useful features in check_mk/Nagios web page:
Master Control -> Notifications - to Enable/Disable

Notifications are send by /usr/local/bin/send_sms.  send_sms limits the number of SMS messages 
to 1 every 'N' minutes, so as to not be overly annoying.  send_sms stores the time of the last 
notification and the notification interval in /var/local/nagios/notifications.json .

Create using the command:
htpasswd ~prod/etc/htpasswd <user>

and adding the user to ~prod/etc/check_mk/multisite.mk
