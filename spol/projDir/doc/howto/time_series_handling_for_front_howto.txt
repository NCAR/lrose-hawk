==================================

Time series on mgen
-------------------

On mgen the time series data is saved temporarily in:

  projDir/data/time_series/sband/tmp

This is scrubbed at 1 day to prevent the disk from filling,
because we have less than 1 TB available.

It is also copied across to pgen1 and pgen2 - see below.

Time series on pgen1 and pgen2
------------------------------

On the pgen hosts, the time series files arrive in:

  projDir/data/time_series/sband/tmp
  
These are scrubbed at 7 days to prevent the disk from filling.

To permanently save a day of time series on the pgen hosts, you 
need to move the day subdirectory into the save directory:

  projDir/data/time_series/sband/save

For example, to save 20140624, you would:

  cd ~/projDir/data/time_series/sband/tmp
  mv 20140623 ../save

The RAID partition /mnt/data2 has a total of 4.8 TB available. Our experience 
during FRONT-DE so far is that a typical day takes about 250 GB.

You should only move about 2 TB into save before cleaning it manually. This
will give 8 operational days of saved data. Keep the other 2.8 TB for tmp data.

Copying the data to eldora.
---------------------------

!! DO NOT DO THIS DURING OPS - there is not enough bandwidth. !!

On eldora, the time series from SPOL is saved in:

  /export/eldora2/rsfdata/firestone/time_series/save

Run the script:

  rsync_time_series.spol

This will rsync all data from

  pgen1:projDir/data/time_series/sband/save

across to
 
  /export/eldora2/rsfdata/firestone/time_series/save

This script runs in the foreground. It is probably best to run it that
way, in a window, so that you don't forget about it and leave it running.

If during ops you notice that HawkEye is skipping sectors, this is a sure
sign that the rsync is running and should be killed.

Cleaning up data on pgen1 and pgen2
------------------------------------

After the saved time series has been copied to eldora, remove it 
on pgen1 and pgen2, to keep the disk space available for realtime
use.
