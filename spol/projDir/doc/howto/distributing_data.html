<h2>Distributing the data</h2>

<p>
There are 2 mechanisms for distributing the data:

<ul>
<li><b>DsFileDist:</b> distributes individual files (raw, NetCDF, MDV etc.)</li><p>
<li><b>DsSpdbServer:</b> distributes SPDB data</li><p>
</ul>

<h3>DsFileDist</h3>
DsFileDist sends a file by contacting the DsFCopyServer process on the
target machine. It is the DsFCopyServer which actually writes the data
to the remote machine's disk.

<p>The DsFileDist program scans the data directories, searching for special
parameter files which control how the data is to be distributed.

<p>The special files are named <b>_DsFileDist</b>, with an optional extension.
They are placed in
directories for which the data is to be distributed.

<p>For example, on the control host, the file:

<pre>    ~/projDir/data/images/spol_cams/_DsFileDist.ext_data</pre>

controls the distribution of the spol camera images to the pgen hosts.

<p>
Most _DsFileDist files will have the following parameter set true:

<p><pre>    use_dest_host_list_file = TRUE;</pre>

In that case the hosts to which the data will be sent are set in the
<a href=#dist_host_list>dist_host_list</a> file.

<p>If <b>use_dest_host_list_file</b> is set to FALSE, DsFileDist will
use the <b>dest_url_list</b> parameter to determine to which hosts the
data should be sent. In this case, the dist_host_list file is ignored.

<p>In addition to the <b>_DsFileDist</b> files, DsFileDist can be instructed
to look for <b>_latest_data_info</b> files. If that is done, DsFileDist
will scan the directory tree for these files, and will distribute
all data sets for which the files are found.

<hr>

<h3>DsSpdbServer</h3> The DsSpdbServer is a server which both writes
the Spdb data to the local disk on a host and optionally copies the data
to remote hosts.

<p>The DsSpdbServer on the local machine copies data by contacting the 
DsSpdbServer on the remote machine. It is the DsSpdbServer on the remote
machine which actually writes the data to the disk.

<p>The DsSpdbServer looks for special files in the data directories,
to determine whether to forward the data to remote hosts.

<p>The special files are named <b>_DsSpdbServer.distrib</b>. They are placed in
directories for which the data is to be distributed.

<p>For example, the file:

<pre>    ~/projDir/data/spdb/ltg/_DsSpdbServer.distrib</pre>

controls the distribution of the SPDB lightning data.

<p>
Most _DsSpdbServer.distrib files will have the following parameter set true:

<p><pre>    use_dest_host_list_file = TRUE;</pre>

In that case the hosts to which the data will be sent are set in the
<a href=#dist_host_list>dist_host_list</a> file.

<p>If <b>use_dest_host_list_file</b> is set to FALSE, DsFileDist will
use the <b>dest_url_list</b> parameter to determine to which hosts the
data should be sent. In this case, the dist_host_list file is ignored.

<hr>
<h3><a name="dist_host_list">dist_host_list file<a></h3>
The dist_host_list files are stred in the systems params directory:

<pre>    ~/projDir/system/params</pre>

<p>These files contains a list of hosts to which the data must be sent,
for both DsFileDist and DsSpdbServer.

<p>For example, the dist_host_list.ext_data file on the control host
contains the following:

<pre>
  #########################
  # Distribution hosts
  #
  localhost
  pgen1
  pgen2
</pre>

<p>DsFileDist will ignore the 'localhost' entry because the files already exist
on the local host. However, the DsSpdbServer will use this entry to indicate
that data should be put to the local host as well as to the remote hosts.
