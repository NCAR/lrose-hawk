HOW TO SET UP S-BAND POWER-METER INTERFACE
==========================================

The S-band powermeters, on H and V, are accessed via a 
Prologix GPIB-to_ethernet interface.

This device is on the 10.1.10 net, with address 10.1.10.50.

The calsvr app reads the powers from this interface, and
then sends the data to syscon. This is then read by
SpolTs2Fmq, and merged into the data stream.

The GPIB interface device seems to lose its IP address
setting when the power to it is removed.

This can be restored to the desired setting (10.1.10.50) using
the nfcli utility provided by Prologix.

The prologix code is located in:

  /usr/local/src/prologix

and the 'nfcli' app is installed in

  /usr/local/bin

The script

  projDir/syscon/scripts/set_powermeter_ipaddress

runs nfcli to set the IP address.

This script is run periodically by cron, which calls

  run_set_powermeter_ipaddress
