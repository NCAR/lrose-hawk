HAWK architecture
=================

The HAWK system runs on a number of hosts. Most of these run LINUX:

 * control (antenna control, monitoring, external data download)
 * rvp8 (RVP8 time series generation)
 * kadrx (Ka-band time series generation)
 * mgen (moments generation)
 * pgen1 (product generation host 1)
 * pgen2 (product generation host 2)
 * spol-dm (data management)
 * spol-dm2 (data management backup, also sci3)
 * sci1, sci2, sci3, sci4, sci5 (displays)
 * eng (engineering display)
 * tech (windows host, PMAC access)

HAWK startup
============

The system is started on each host individually.
The order of startup is not important.

To start the system on a host:

  Log in as operator
  Run the command 'start_all'

This will start all of the processes on that host.

The start_all script performs the following:

  start_procmap:

    Starts the process mapper, with which all of the processes
    register to let the system know they are up and running.

  procmap_list_start:

    Starts all of the processes in the process list:

      ~/projDir/control/proc_list

  start_auto_restart:

    Starts the auto restart script.  This checks with the process
    mapper every 30 seconds to make sure that all of the processes are
    running.  Any processes which are not running are restarted.

  install_crontab:

    Installs the cron table:

      ~/projDir/control/crontab

As a minimum, the cron table will contain entries to make sure that
the process mapper and auto restarter stay alive. It check on these
every minute. Depending on the host type, the cron table will contain
other commands as well.

Checking the running system
===========================

There are a number of aliases set up to help you check the system.

ppm:

  ppm, or
  print_procmap -hb -up -status

This contacts procmap and obtains a list of running processes.

pcheck:

  pcheck, or
  procmap_list_check -proc_list $PROJ_DIR/control/proc_list

This checks that all required processes are running.

pdm:

  pdm, or
  PrintDataMap -all -relt -lreg

This contacts the DataMapper and prints out the status of the data sets on disk.

HAWK shutdown
=============

Generally, is it not necessary to shutdown HAWK. It can keep running
for an entire project.

To shut it down:

  Log in as operator
  Run the command 'stop_all'

The stop_all script runs the following scripts:

  remove_crontab:

    Remove the cron table so that processes are not restarted after
    the shutdown.

  kill_auto_restart:

    Kill the auto_restart script.

  killall_processes:

    Kill all running processes
