Power PMAC notes
Logging in:
ssh -l root powerpmac  # 192.168.4.52
see Joe or Mike for the password.

System logs for "antcon", aka capp1:
/var/log/capp1

capp1 executable is:
/var/ftp/usrflash/Project/C Language/Background Programs/capp1.out

The powerpmac project is configured to run capp1.out with its output piped through
 /usr/local/bin/timestamper -m 30000 /var/log/capp1/capp1.log

This provides autorotation of logs, so the /var/log/capp1 directory doesn't fill up.





Backup powerpmac:
The backup powerpmac has I.P. address 192.168.4.39

If the primary powerpmac fails, you will need to edit
control1:/home/operator/projDir/syscon/spol.syscon.conf

and change 
deltatau_server = powerpmac.gate.rtf

to
deltatau_server = powerpmac.gate2.rtf

After editing spol.syscon.conf,
type
$ restart_control
