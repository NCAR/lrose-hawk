INSTALL NOTES FOR SPOL HAWK DATA SYSTEM
=======================================

1. Make data directory

/data/operator must exist and be owned by operator.

The data dir will be /data/operator/data

2. Evoke a c shell

csh

3. set the CVS USER and CVSROOT

setenv CVS_USER dixon

5. check out distrib for your host type

cd cvs
cvs co distribs/spol

  ./distribs/spol/hawk/spol_mgen_checkout
  ./distribs/spol/hawk/spol_pgen_checkout
  ./distribs/spol/hawk/spol_display_checkout

6. For an operational installation, the host_type will be
determined by the script:

  ./projects/spol/hawk/projDir/system/scripts/get_host_type

If you want to emulate a host type on a non-operational host,
edit this file and put your host name in the file appropriately.
